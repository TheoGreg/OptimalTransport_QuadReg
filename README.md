# Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport on Graphs

Final individual project for Computational Optimal Transport course directed by Gabriel Peyr√© at MVA (ENS Paris-Saclay).

## Objective

The goal of this project was reproducing results and analyzing behaviours from the following recent article :

Montacer  Essid  and  Justin  Solomon. _Quadratically-Regularized Optimal Transport on Graphs._ 2018 (available on arxiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08200))

## Results

The full report is available on the repository as well. Here are showcased a few visual results examples.
